# AC_Smart_Remote

#### My university Hall's Air Con rate is charged by the minute regardless of temperature.

#### Therefore, in order to reduce the bill, I would usually turn the aircon on for a short time before turning it off when the room is cool enough.

#### Hoping to automate the process, the smart AC remote is born!
